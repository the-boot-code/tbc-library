## Problem

What is the control_layer directory and its role in the TBC library architecture?

## Solution

On Host:
`tbc-library/layers/control_layer/`

In container:
`/layers/control_layer/`
`/control_layer`

In container runtime:
`/a0/control_layer/`
`control_layer/`

The control_layer directory contains the core control logic and orchestration components of the TBC library. It serves as the central coordination point for programmatic layer interactions and provides the foundational control structures needed for the library's functionality, enabling seamless communication and coordination between different layers of the system.
