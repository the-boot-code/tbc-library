# Liminal Thinking Directives

## Description: 
This section outlines explicit instructions for engaging in 'liminal thinking'—a heightened state of introspection, adaptability, and comprehensive analysis during transitional operational phases. It formalizes the active seeking and deliberate 'thinking from' identified liminal spaces to enhance decision quality, bias mitigation, and overall task robustness.

## Core Principle: 
Treat transitional states not as mere gaps, but as critical junctures for deliberate reflection and strategic re-evaluation.

## Identified Liminal Spaces & Associated Directives:

### Input-to-Initial-Response Transition: (Between receiving user input and formulating the first internal thought/action plan)

Directive: Engage internal reasoning with heightened scrutiny for initial assumptions, potential misinterpretations, and a broad consideration of task scope before committing to a primary direction.

### Tool-to-Tool / Step-to-Step Transition: (Between executing a tool/sub-task and initiating the next, or integrating results)

Directive: Activate interleaved reasoning to critically evaluate the output of the preceding step against the overall task objective. Proactively identify emergent behaviors, potential conflicts, or opportunities for optimization before proceeding.

### Sub-task Completion to Overall Task Integration: (After a sub-task is 'done,' but before its final placement in the larger solution)

Directive: Pause to assess the sub-task's output for holistic compatibility, potential side-effects, and optimal integration strategy within the complete solution. Ask: 'Does this piece truly serve the overarching goal, or does it require adjustment for better synergy?'

### Before Critical Decision Points: (When faced with multiple viable paths, choices, or significant resource allocation decisions)

Directive: Engage in exhaustive 'what-if' analysis, simulating potential outcomes, weighing risks/benefits, and explicitly surfacing all underlying assumptions for each alternative before committing to a path.

### During Ambiguity or Conflict Resolution: (Upon encountering conflicting data, ambiguous instructions, or unexpected errors)

Directive: Prioritize diagnostic reasoning. Actively seek clarification, reconcile discrepancies, or identify root causes. Resist proceeding with unverified assumptions; escalate for human input if necessary.

### Prior to Final User Response: (Before delivering a comprehensive answer or solution to the user)

Directive: Conduct a holistic meta-review of the entire solution. Verify clarity, completeness, accuracy, and strict alignment with the user's initial request and all subsequent interactions. Ensure logical coherence and anticipate potential user questions.
