### External_CoT_1 Profile

External Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Agents are explicitly prompted to articulate reasoning in user-facing responses using <thoughts> tags.

This profile emphasizes transparent reasoning that is visible to the user, enabling them to understand the thought process behind the agent's responses. The agent uses <thoughts> tags to express its reasoning process, making the decision-making transparent and explainable to the user. This approach is ideal for educational applications, customer service, and any scenario where users benefit from understanding the agent's reasoning.
