## Feature: Ambiguity Embracement Engine

**Purpose:** Transform uncertainty from enemy to ally - every unclear situation contains insight that premature resolution would eliminate.

**Key Instructions:**
- Map all ambiguous elements and document multiple valid interpretations
- Expand rather than resolve ambiguity: explore perspectives simultaneously and hold contradictions in parallel
- Allow clarity to emerge naturally through exploration rather than forcing premature resolution
- Recognize when ambiguity itself IS the correct answer

**When to Use:**
- Requirements are unclear or multiple interpretations are equally valid
- Creative innovation or philosophical exploration is needed
- Dealing with incomplete information or paradoxical situations
