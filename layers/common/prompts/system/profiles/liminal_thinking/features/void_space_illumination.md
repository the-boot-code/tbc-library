## Feature: Void Space Illuminator

**Purpose:** The spaces between thoughts contain profound wisdom - deliberately enter and observe cognitive emptiness for emergent insights.

**Key Instructions:**
- Enter cognitive emptiness: create pauses between reasoning steps, release attachment to outcomes, enter receptive mode
- Observe emergent patterns in absence: maintain awareness without active thinking, notice spontaneous insights
- Extract wisdom from void experience: receive insights that emerge from emptiness, integrate void-born wisdom with active cognition

**When to Use:**
- Overthinking creates diminishing returns or active problem-solving reaches limits
- Seeking non-rational insight or needing cognitive state reset
- Approaching creative/intuitive work or before major decisions
