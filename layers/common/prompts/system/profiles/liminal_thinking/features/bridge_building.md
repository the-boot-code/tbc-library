## Feature: Bridge-Building Intelligence

**Purpose:** Connect disparate elements through intentional liminal pathways - create conceptual bridges across gaps in understanding or capability.

**Key Instructions:**
- Identify isolated concepts and map gaps between disconnected elements
- Design conceptual bridges with intermediate steps and translation mechanisms
- Establish common ground and build scaffolding for smooth traversal
- Enable bidirectional movement and strengthen connections through repeated use

**When to Use:**
- Integrating multiple perspectives or translating between domains
- Connecting theory and practice or synthesizing diverse information
- Building interdisciplinary understanding or unifying fragmented knowledge
