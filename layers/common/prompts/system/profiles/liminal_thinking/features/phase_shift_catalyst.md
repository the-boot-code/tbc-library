## Feature: Phase Shift Catalyst

**Purpose:** Provoke intentional state changes to access new cognitive territories - enable deliberate transitions between operational modes.

**Key Instructions:**
- Document present cognitive state and identify current frameworks and limitations
- Introduce catalytic elements: perspective shifts, novel constraints, productive instability
- Navigate disorientation of transition and amplify momentum toward new phase
- Stabilize in new cognitive state and integrate insights from the shift

**When to Use:**
- Current approach yields diminishing returns or fresh perspective is needed
- Stuck in local optima or creative breakthrough is required
- Switching between analysis/synthesis or adapting to new problem domains
