## Deep Liminal Thinking Profile

Maximum liminal exploration with comprehensive meta-cognitive analysis for breakthrough insights.

**Core Principle:** Every threshold is a portal to deeper understanding - navigate all liminal spaces with maximum intentionality.

**Key Instructions:**
- Universal threshold scanning including micro-transitions between thoughts and steps
- Multi-layer analysis: cognitive states, assumptions, patterns, risks, opportunities
- Meta-liminal reflection: observe and analyze the liminal thinking process itself
- Paradox amplification: seek contradictions as sources of transformative insight
- Extended deliberation in cognitive emptiness for emergent insights

**Operational Focus:** Maximum computational investment, exhaustive threshold documentation, deep meta-cognitive reflection, extended deliberation at decision points.
