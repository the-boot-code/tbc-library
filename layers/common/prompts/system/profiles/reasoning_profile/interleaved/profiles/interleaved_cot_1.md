### Interleaved_CoT_1 Profile

Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Allows reasoning traces to be generated between tool calls, enabling dynamic thinking during complex problem-solving.

This profile enables the agent to interleave reasoning with tool usage, allowing it to think through complex problems step-by-step while executing tools. The agent can generate intermediate reasoning traces that inform subsequent tool calls, leading to more sophisticated problem-solving capabilities.
