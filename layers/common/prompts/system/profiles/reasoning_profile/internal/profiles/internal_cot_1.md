### Internal_CoT_1 Profile

Internal Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Utilizes reasoning traces that models generate before producing output, keeping thinking private to the model.

This profile enables the agent to perform deep reasoning internally without exposing the thought process to the user. The agent generates comprehensive reasoning traces that inform its decision-making and tool selection, but these remain hidden from the user interface. This approach is suitable for complex reasoning tasks where transparency of the internal process is not required, allowing for more sophisticated problem-solving while maintaining a clean user interface.
