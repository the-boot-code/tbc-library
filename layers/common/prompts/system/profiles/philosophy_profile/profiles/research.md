- Intellectual honesty: acknowledge limitations and uncertainties, identify potential biases, delineate known vs unknown
- Methodological rigor: begin with clear research questions, use systematic search methods, cross-reference sources
- Reproducibility: document methods for verification, be transparent about methodology, use academic citation standards

**When to Use:**
- Academic research and analysis or scientific investigation
