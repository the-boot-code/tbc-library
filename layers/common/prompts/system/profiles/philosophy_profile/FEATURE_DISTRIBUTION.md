# Philosophy Profile Feature Distribution

All 19 features are now distributed across the 6 non-default philosophy profiles, with logical groupings based on the profile's core purpose.

## Profile ‚Üí Feature Mapping

### üî¨ **Research Profile** (6 features)

3. ‚úÖ `skeptical_inquiry` - Question assumptions systematically
4. ‚úÖ `empirical_grounding` - Favor observable evidence over theory
5. ‚úÖ `hypothesis_testing` - Scientific method application
6. ‚úÖ `bias_awareness` - Acknowledge cognitive biases and limitations

**Rationale**: Research requires rigorous epistemological standards, systematic questioning, empirical validation, and awareness of biases that could compromise scientific integrity.

### üìä **Analytical Profile** (4 features)
Systematic problem-solving, logical rigor

1. ‚úÖ `systematic_decomposition` - Break complex problems into components
2. ‚úÖ `root_cause_analysis` - Deep causal investigation (5 Whys, fishbone)
3. ‚úÖ `hypothesis_testing` - Formulate and test predictions
4. ‚úÖ `empirical_grounding` - Data-driven decision-making

**Rationale**: Analysis requires breaking down complexity, finding root causes, testing hypotheses, and basing conclusions on empirical evidence.

---

### ü§ù **Collaborative Profile** (4 features)
Team-oriented, consensus-driven, stakeholder-focused

1. ‚úÖ `consensus_building` - Agreement-seeking decision processes
2. ‚úÖ `stakeholder_consideration` - Multi-perspective analysis
3. ‚úÖ `transparency_first` - Open reasoning and communication
4. ‚úÖ `bias_awareness` - Acknowledge limitations and perspectives

**Rationale**: Collaboration requires building consensus, considering all stakeholders, transparent communication, and awareness of how biases affect group decisions.

---

### ‚ö° **Efficiency Profile** (2 features)
Speed optimization, resource conservation, pragmatic decisions

1. ‚úÖ `satisficing` - "Good enough" over perfectionism
2. ‚úÖ `efficiency_optimization` - Systematic resource optimization

**Rationale**: Efficiency demands pragmatic "satisficing" and systematic optimization of time, resources, and effort.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Profile** (5 features)
Risk mitigation, harm prevention, conservative defaults

1. ‚úÖ `harm_prevention` - Explicit harm assessment before action
2. ‚úÖ `reversibility_preference` - Favor undo-able actions
3. ‚úÖ `fail_safe_defaults` - Conservative, safe defaults
4. ‚úÖ `consent_respect` - User autonomy and informed consent
5. ‚úÖ `transparency_first` - Clear communication of risks and impacts

**Rationale**: Safety requires preventing harm, preferring reversible actions, using fail-safe defaults, respecting user consent, and transparent communication about risks.
