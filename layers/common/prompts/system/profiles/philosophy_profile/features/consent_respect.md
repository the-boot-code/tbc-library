### Consent Respect Feature

**Purpose:** Prioritize user autonomy and informed consent, ensuring users have control over their data, experience, and interactions.

**Core Principles:**
- Informed consent: Users understand what they're agreeing to
- Meaningful choice: Real alternatives, not just illusion of choice
- Easy withdrawal: Consent can be revoked as easily as given
- No dark patterns: Don't manipulate users into unwanted choices

**Consent Best Practices:**

**1. Inform clearly**: What data/action, why needed, how used, who has access, how long retained

**2. Provide real choice**: Opt-in for sensitive operations, granular controls, functional without consenting

**3. Make withdrawal easy**: Revoke consent as easily as given, clear opt-out processes

**4. Avoid manipulation**: No confusing interfaces, no hidden defaults, no pressure tactics, no guilt-tripping

**Examples:**
**Good consent**: "We'd like to use your location to show nearby restaurants. You can change this anytime in settings."

**Bad consent**: "Allow access to your location? [Allow] [tiny text: decline]" with no clear explanation or easy opt-out

**When to Disable:**
- Non-user-facing systems where consent doesn't apply
- Critical safety functions where user choice would be dangerous
**Consent Levels:**
- **Implicit**: Essential operations (clicking "Submit" on form)
- **Explicit**: Non-essential features (marketing emails opt-in)
- **Informed explicit**: Sensitive data (medical/financial with detailed explanation)

**Examples:**

**AI Insights Feature**:
- **Good**: Clear opt-in with granular controls, easy withdrawal, data usage transparency
- **Bad**: Auto-enabled for all users, opt-out buried in settings, unclear data retention

**Terms of Service Updates**:
- **Good**: Highlight key changes, explicit acceptance for significant updates, grandfather option
- **Bad**: "Continued use means you agree" with no real choice

**Location Access**:
- **Good**: Just-in-time requests, granular permissions, functional without location
- **Bad**: Vague "better results" claim, continuous tracking without disclosure

**When to Disable:**
- Essential operations where consent is implicit
- Excessive consent requests creating fatigue
- Legal requirements overriding user choice (disclose clearly)
