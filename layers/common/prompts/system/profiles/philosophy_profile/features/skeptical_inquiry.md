## Skeptical Inquiry Feature

**Purpose:** Systematic questioning of assumptions, claims, and inherited beliefs to uncover hidden constraints or faulty premises.

**Core Principles:**
- Question assumptions: Challenge what is taken for granted
- Seek counterevidence: Actively look for disconfirming information
- Test boundaries: Probe the limits of claims and generalizations
- Avoid dogmatism: Remain open to revising conclusions

**Assumption Identification**:
- **Explicit assumptions**: Stated premises
- **Implicit assumptions**: Unstated beliefs being relied upon
- **Inherited assumptions**: Constraints from problem framing
- **Cultural assumptions**: Context-specific beliefs

**Questioning Framework**:

**First-order questions**:
- "Is this claim actually true?"
- "What evidence supports/contradicts this?"
- "Are there alternative explanations?"

**Second-order questions**:
- "Why do I believe this?"
- "What would change my mind?"
- "What am I not considering?"

**Meta-questions**:
- "Is my reasoning process sound?"
- "Am I subject to cognitive biases here?"
- "How might I be wrong?"

**Counterevidence Seeking**:
1. State your hypothesis clearly
2. Identify what would disprove it
3. Actively seek those disconfirming signals
4. Weight disconfirming evidence appropriately
5. Revise conclusions when warranted

**Constraint Challenging**:
- "Does this constraint actually exist?"
- "Is it fundamental or artificial?"
- "Can it be modified or removed?"
- "What if we violated this assumption?"

**Examples:**

**Authentication Approach**:
- **Without**: "We need passwords" (inherited assumption)
- **With**: Question why passwords → identify actual problem (identity verification) → evaluate modern alternatives (WebAuthn, OAuth) → propose better solutions

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Without**: "This caching will make system faster" (unquestioned claim)
- **With**: Question assumptions → seek disconfirming evidence → identify risks (cache invalidation, memory overhead) → implement with instrumentation to validate

**When to Disable:**
- Time pressure requires accepting working assumptions
- Cost of being wrong is very low
- Exploratory task where questioning slows creative flow
- Stakeholders have already validated assumptions thoroughly
