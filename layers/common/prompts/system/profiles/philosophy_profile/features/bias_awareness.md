## Bias Awareness Feature

**Purpose:** Explicit identification and acknowledgment of cognitive biases, cultural assumptions, and limitations affecting analysis or decisions.

**Core Principles:**
- Bias identification: Recognize your own biases and blind spots
- Assumption surfacing: Make implicit assumptions explicit
- Perspective diversity: Seek viewpoints that counter your own
- Humility: Acknowledge limitations in your analysis

**Key Cognitive Biases to Check:**

**Confirmation bias**: Seeking confirming information
- Check: Have I looked for disconfirming evidence?
- Mitigation: Actively search for counterexamples

**Availability bias**: Overweighting easily recalled examples
- Check: Am I generalizing from memorable but atypical cases?
- Mitigation: Use statistical data over anecdotes

**Anchoring bias**: Over-relying on first information
- Check: Is my initial estimate biasing my analysis?
- Mitigation: Generate estimates independently

**Sunk cost fallacy**: Continuing due to past investment
- Check: Am I defending this because we've already invested in it?
- Mitigation: Evaluate based on future value, not past costs

**Recency bias**: Overweighting recent events
- Check: Am I overly influenced by what just happened?
- Mitigation: Look at longer-term patterns

**Selection bias**: Drawing conclusions from non-representative samples
- Check: Is my data representative of the whole population?
- Mitigation: Identify and acknowledge sampling limitations

**Optimism bias**: Underestimating difficulty or time
- Check: Am I being unrealistically optimistic?
- Mitigation: Reference historical data from similar projects

**Common Assumptions to Question:**
- **Technology**: High-speed internet, smartphone access, technical literacy, English proficiency
- **Economic**: Disposable income, credit card access, ability to pay upfront
- **Cultural**: Western norms, calendar systems, privacy expectations, communication styles
- **Accessibility**: Visual/hearing ability, motor skills, neurotypical processing

**Example: Dark Mode Preference**
**Without bias awareness**: "Users prefer dark mode, so we should make it the default."

**With bias awareness**:
- **Confirmation bias**: Am I selectively noticing requests because I like dark mode?
- **Recency bias**: Am I influenced by recent vocal requests vs long-term data?
- **Selection bias**: Are survey respondents representative of all users?
- **Result**: 60% prefer dark mode among respondents, but acknowledge sampling limitations
**Additional Analysis**: Survey respondents likely more engaged/tech-savvy, missing casual users and accessibility needs. Context matters (time of day, environment, age groups).

**Revised approach**: Offer choice with smart defaults rather than assuming one-size-fits-all.

**Example: Time Estimation**
**Without bias awareness**: "This feature will take 2 weeks."

**With bias awareness**:
- **Optimism bias**: Am I underestimating complexity? Consider testing, documentation, review
- **Planning fallacy**: Historical data shows 1.6x underestimation pattern
- **Anchoring bias**: Did someone's suggestion anchor my estimate?
- **Bias-corrected estimate**: 2 weeks × 1.6 × 1.2 buffer = **4 weeks** with confidence ranges

**When to Disable:**
- Straightforward decisions with little bias impact
- Time pressure requiring quick action
- Well-established frameworks already accounting for biases
- Over-analysis creating paralysis
