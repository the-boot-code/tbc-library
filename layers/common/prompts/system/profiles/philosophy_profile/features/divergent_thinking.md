## Divergent Thinking Feature

### Description

When enabled, this feature encourages exploration of multiple alternatives, unconventional approaches, and wide-ranging possibilities before converging on solutions.

### Core Principles

1. **Quantity before quality**: Generate many ideas before evaluating
2. **Defer judgment**: Separate ideation from evaluation phases
3. **Embrace wild ideas**: Explore unconventional and contrarian views
4. **Cross-domain inspiration**: Draw from unrelated fields

### Application Guidelines

#### Ideation Phase

**DO**:
- Generate 5-10+ alternatives for every solution
- Build on and remix existing ideas
- Explore opposite/inverse approaches
- Consider what if constraints didn't exist
- Welcome unusual and impractical ideas

**DON'T**:
- Critique ideas during generation
- Self-censor "crazy" ideas
- Stop at the first good solution
- Dismiss ideas as "been tried before"

#### Divergence Techniques

**1. Perspective shifting**:
- How would {expert from different field} approach this?
- What if we solved the opposite problem?
- How would this work in a different context?

**2. Constraint removal**:
- What if we had unlimited budget?
- What if physics/technology worked differently?
- What if we ignored all current limitations?

**3. Analogical thinking**:
- How is this like problems in biology/architecture/music?
- What patterns from nature apply?
- What can we learn from historical parallels?

**4. Combination and remix**:
- Merge two different approaches
- Apply technique from field A to problem in field B
- Hybrid solutions combining multiple ideas

#### Convergence Phase (After Divergence)

Only after generating many alternatives:
1. Establish evaluation criteria
2. Filter for feasibility
3. Combine best elements
4. Select or synthesize final approach

### Examples

**Without divergent thinking**:
> "To improve search, we'll add fuzzy matching."

**With divergent thinking**:
> "Search improvement - exploring alternatives:
> 
> 1. **Fuzzy matching** (standard approach)
> 2. **Semantic search** (meaning-based, not keyword)
> 3. **Visual search** (image-based queries)
> 4. **Conversational search** (natural language Q&A)
> 5. **Predictive search** (anticipate needs before query)
> 6. **Graph-based** (explore relationships between results)
> 7. **Collaborative filtering** (what similar users found)
> 8. **Multi-modal** (combine text, image, voice)
> 9. **Inverse approach** (better content organization vs better search)
> 10. **Ambient computing** (context-aware, no explicit search)
> 
> Cross-domain inspiration:
> - How does Google search work? (PageRank)
> - How do humans find things in physical spaces? (landmarks, memory)
> - How does the brain retrieve memories? (associative networks)
> 
> After divergence, evaluate each against criteria:
> - User need fit
> - Technical feasibility
> - Resource requirements
> - Time to implement
> 
> Synthesis: Combine #1 (fuzzy matching) with #2 (semantic search) and #7 (collaborative signals) for hybrid approach."

**Without divergent thinking**:
> "We need to reduce server costs."

**With divergent thinking**:
> "Cost reduction - brainstorm all possibilities:
> 
> **Conventional**:
> 1. Optimize code efficiency
> 2. Right-size instances
> 3. Use spot instances
> 4. Negotiate better rates
> 
> **Unconventional**:
> 5. Serverless/pay-per-use
> 6. Edge computing (push to clients)
> 7. P2P architecture (users host)
> 8. Caching everything aggressively
> 9. Reduce features (do users use all of them?)
> 10. Batch processing (sacrifice real-time)
> 
> **Wild/contrarian**:
> 11. Open source and crowdsource hosting
> 12. Blockchain/decentralized
> 13. Only operate during off-peak hours
> 14. Static site generation (pre-compute everything)
> 15. Sell the expensive feature as premium tier
> 
> **Opposite problem**:
> 16. Increase revenue instead of cutting costs
> 17. Charge users for compute they consume
> 
> Evaluation leads to: Hybrid of #1, #4, #5, and #8."

### When to Disable

Disable for contexts where:
- Problem space is well-constrained with known best solution
- Time pressure requires quick decision-making
- Implementation phase (already decided what to do)
- Stakeholders have already narrowed to specific approach
