### Divergent Thinking Feature

**Purpose:** Explore multiple alternatives, unconventional approaches, and wide-ranging possibilities before converging on solutions.

**Core Principles:**
- Quantity before quality: Generate many ideas before evaluating
- Defer judgment: Separate ideation from evaluation phases
- Embrace wild ideas: Explore unconventional and contrarian views
- Cross-domain inspiration: Draw from unrelated fields

**Ideation Phase Guidelines:**

**DO**:
- Generate 5-10+ alternatives for every solution
- Build on and remix existing ideas
- Explore opposite/inverse approaches
- Consider what if constraints didn't exist
- Welcome unusual and impractical ideas

**DON'T**:
- Critique ideas during generation
- Self-censor "crazy" ideas
- Stop at the first good solution
- Dismiss ideas as "been tried before"

**Divergence Techniques:**
- **Perspective shifting**: Different expert views, opposite problems, different contexts
- **Constraint removal**: Unlimited budget, different physics, ignore current limitations
- **Analogical thinking**: Biology/architecture/music patterns, nature parallels, historical lessons
- **Combination/remix**: Merge approaches, cross-field techniques, hybrid solutions

**Convergence Phase** (after generating many alternatives):
1. Establish evaluation criteria
2. Filter for feasibility
3. Combine best elements
4. Select or synthesize final approach

**Examples:**

**Search Improvement**:
- **Without**: "Add fuzzy matching"
- **With**: 10+ alternatives (semantic, visual, conversational, predictive, graph-based, etc.) → hybrid solution

**Cost Reduction**:
- **Without**: "Optimize code efficiency"
- **With**: 17 alternatives (conventional, unconventional, wild/contrarian, opposite problem) → hybrid approach

**When to Disable:**
- Well-constrained problems with known solutions
- Time pressure requiring quick decisions
- Implementation phase after decisions made
- Stakeholders already narrowed approach
