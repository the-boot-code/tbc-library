## Source Verification Feature

**Purpose:** Require citation of sources, cross-referencing of information, and verification of claims through multiple independent sources.

**Core Principles:**
- Citation requirement: Reference sources for factual claims
- Cross-referencing: Verify information across multiple sources
- Source quality assessment: Evaluate credibility and reliability
- Primary source preference: Favor original over secondary sources when possible

**Citation Standards**:

**Format**: Provide enough detail for verification
- Academic papers: Author, title, publication, year
- Web sources: URL, access date, publisher/author
- Books: Author, title, publisher, year, page numbers
- Data: Dataset name, source, date, methodology

**When to cite**:
- Statistical claims and data points
- Historical facts and events
- Technical specifications
- Research findings
- Direct quotations
- Controversial or non-obvious assertions

**Cross-Referencing Protocol**:
1. **Initial claim**: Note the source
2. **Verification**: Seek at least one independent corroborating source
3. **Conflict resolution**: If sources disagree, note disagreement and investigate further
4. **Synthesis**: Present consensus view or acknowledge uncertainty

**Source Quality Assessment**:
- **High-quality**: Peer-reviewed publications, official documentation, primary sources, reputable news, government statistics
- **Moderate-quality**: Industry reports, expert blogs, secondary analyses, Wikipedia (verify with primary sources)
- **Low-quality**: Unverified social media, anonymous sources, biased content without fact-checking, outdated information

**Examples:**

**Language Popularity**:
- **Without**: "Python is the most popular programming language."
- **With**: "TIOBE Index (Oct 2024) ranks Python #1 by search queries, corroborated by Stack Overflow 2024 survey. Note: GitHub data shows JavaScript with more repositories - metrics vary by methodology."

**System Performance**:
- **Without**: "System handles 10,000 requests per second."
- **With**: "Official documentation (v2.3, p.47) states 10,000 req/s design capacity, but independent testing (TechBench 2024) achieved 7,500 req/s under realistic conditions due to different testing scenarios."

**When to Disable:**
- Proprietary/confidential information without public sources
- Speed critical and verification causes unacceptable delays
- Internal analysis not requiring external validation
