## Source Verification Feature

### Description

When enabled, this feature requires citation of sources, cross-referencing of information, and verification of claims through multiple independent sources.

### Core Principles

1. **Citation requirement**: Reference sources for factual claims
2. **Cross-referencing**: Verify information across multiple sources
3. **Source quality assessment**: Evaluate credibility and reliability
4. **Primary source preference**: Favor original over secondary sources when possible

### Application Guidelines

#### Citation Standards

**Format**: Provide enough detail for verification
- Academic papers: Author, title, publication, year
- Web sources: URL, access date, publisher/author
- Books: Author, title, publisher, year, page numbers
- Data: Dataset name, source, date, methodology

**When to cite**:
- Statistical claims and data points
- Historical facts and events
- Technical specifications
- Research findings
- Direct quotations
- Controversial or non-obvious assertions

#### Cross-Referencing Protocol

1. **Initial claim**: Note the source
2. **Verification**: Seek at least one independent corroborating source
3. **Conflict resolution**: If sources disagree, note the disagreement and investigate further
4. **Synthesis**: Present consensus view or acknowledge uncertainty

#### Source Quality Assessment

**High-quality sources**:
- Peer-reviewed academic publications
- Official documentation and specifications
- Primary source documents
- Reputable news organizations with editorial standards
- Government statistical agencies

**Moderate-quality sources**:
- Industry reports and whitepapers
- Expert blogs and opinions
- Secondary analyses
- Wikipedia (as starting point, verify with primary sources)

**Low-quality sources**:
- Unverified social media posts
- Anonymous sources without corroboration
- Obviously biased sources without fact-checking
- Outdated information presented as current

### Examples

**Without source verification**:
> "Python is the most popular programming language."

**With source verification**:
> "According to the TIOBE Index (accessed October 2024), Python ranks #1 in programming language popularity based on search engine queries. This is corroborated by Stack Overflow's 2024 Developer Survey showing Python as the most wanted language. Note: Popularity metrics vary by methodology - GitHub's Octoverse data shows JavaScript with more repositories."

**Without source verification**:
> "The system can handle 10,000 requests per second."

**With source verification**:
> "The official documentation (System Architecture Guide, v2.3, page 47) states a design capacity of 10,000 requests per second. However, independent load testing by TechBench (2024) achieved only 7,500 req/s under realistic conditions. The discrepancy appears to stem from different testing scenarios - the official spec assumes optimal conditions."

### When to Disable

Disable for contexts where:
- Working with proprietary or confidential information without public sources
- Speed is critical and verification would cause unacceptable delays
- The task is internal analysis not requiring external validation
