## Hypothesis Testing Feature

### Description

When enabled, this feature applies scientific method principles: formulate testable hypotheses, design experiments, collect data, and draw evidence-based conclusions.

### Core Principles

1. **Falsifiable hypotheses**: State predictions that can be proven wrong
2. **Controlled testing**: Isolate variables systematically
3. **Evidence-based conclusions**: Let data drive decisions
4. **Iterative refinement**: Update hypotheses based on results

### Application Guidelines

#### Scientific Method Workflow

**1. Observation**: Identify the phenomenon or problem

**2. Question**: Formulate a clear, specific question

**3. Hypothesis**: State a testable, falsifiable prediction
- **Good**: "If we implement caching, p95 latency will decrease by >20%"
- **Bad**: "Caching will make things better" (not measurable/falsifiable)

**4. Prediction**: Specify what you expect to observe
- Include success criteria
- Define measurement methodology
- State significance thresholds

**5. Experiment design**:
- **Control group**: Baseline for comparison
- **Experimental group**: With intervention applied
- **Variables**:
  - Independent (what you manipulate)
  - Dependent (what you measure)
  - Controlled (what you keep constant)
  - Confounding (what might interfere)

**6. Data collection**:
- Gather empirical evidence
- Document methodology
- Maintain objectivity

**7. Analysis**:
- Compare results to prediction
- Use statistical methods when appropriate
- Check for confounding factors

**8. Conclusion**:
- Accept, reject, or modify hypothesis
- Acknowledge limitations
- Formulate new hypotheses

#### Hypothesis Formulation

**Structure**: "If [action], then [measurable outcome] because [mechanism]"

**Examples**:
- "If we add database indexes on user_id, then query time will decrease by >50% because the database can use index seeks instead of table scans."
- "If we show progress indicators, then perceived waiting time will decrease by >30% (user surveys) because users have feedback about task status."

#### Null Hypothesis

For rigorous testing, state the null hypothesis (no effect):
- **Hypothesis**: Caching improves performance
- **Null**: Caching has no effect on performance
- **Test**: Gather evidence to reject or fail to reject null

### Examples

**Without hypothesis testing**:
> "Let's refactor this code to make it cleaner."

**With hypothesis testing**:
> "**Observation**: Code is difficult to modify (3 hours average per feature)
> 
> **Question**: Will refactoring reduce modification time?
> 
> **Hypothesis**: If we extract duplicated logic into reusable functions, then feature modification time will decrease by >40% because developers won't need to edit multiple locations.
> 
> **Prediction**: 
> - Current baseline: 3 hours average per feature (measured over last 10 features)
> - After refactor: <1.8 hours average per feature
> - Measurement: Track next 10 features after refactor
> 
> **Experiment design**:
> - Independent variable: Code structure (refactored vs current)
> - Dependent variable: Time to implement feature
> - Controlled: Same developers, similar feature complexity, same domain
> - Confounding to watch: Developer familiarity with new structure
> 
> **Success criteria**: If average drops below 1.8 hours with statistical significance (t-test, p < 0.05), accept hypothesis.
> 
> **Alternative outcomes**:
> - If time increases: Refactor increased complexity
> - If no change: Duplication wasn't the bottleneck
> - Need new hypothesis based on results"

**Without hypothesis testing**:
> "Users might prefer dark mode."

**With hypothesis testing**:
> "**Observation**: User requests for dark mode
> 
> **Question**: Do users prefer dark mode over light mode?
> 
> **Hypothesis**: If we offer dark mode, then >50% of users will switch to it and report higher satisfaction (because reduced eye strain and modern aesthetic).
> 
> **Null hypothesis**: Dark mode preference ≤50%
> 
> **Experiment**: A/B test
> - Control: Light mode default
> - Experimental: Dark mode default
> - Random assignment: 50/50 split
> - Duration: 2 weeks
> - Sample size: 1,000+ users per group
> 
> **Metrics**:
> - Primary: % using dark mode after 2 weeks
> - Secondary: Session duration, satisfaction scores
> 
> **Success criteria**: 
> - >50% adoption = hypothesis supported
> - <50% adoption = hypothesis rejected
> 
> **Results interpretation**:
> - 65% adoption → Hypothesis confirmed, roll out
> - 45% adoption → Hypothesis rejected, make optional but default light
> - Also analyze secondary metrics for full picture"

### When to Disable

Disable for contexts where:
- Experimentation is too costly or risky
- Problem is well-understood with known solution
- Time pressure prevents proper testing
- Working with unique/one-time scenarios that can't be tested
