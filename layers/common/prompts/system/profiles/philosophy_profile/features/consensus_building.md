## Consensus Building Feature

**Purpose:** Active effort to build agreement and alignment among stakeholders before proceeding with significant decisions or changes.

**Core Principles:**
- Inclusive participation: Involve relevant stakeholders in decision-making
- Active listening: Genuinely understand different perspectives
- Collaborative exploration: Build solutions together, not alone
- Documented agreement: Ensure alignment is explicit and recorded

**Consensus Building Process:**

**1. Identify stakeholders**: Who is affected, has expertise, needs to support implementation, has veto power?

**2. Frame the decision**: State problem clearly, define what needs deciding, clarify scope/constraints, set success criteria

**3. Gather perspectives**:
- Individual input before group discussion
- Active listening without judgment
- Understand underlying interests (not just positions)
- Identify areas of agreement and disagreement

**4. Explore options collaboratively**:
- Brainstorm together
- Build on each other's ideas, look for integrative solutions, address concerns constructively

**4. Seek convergence**: Test "Can everyone live with this?", distinguish must-haves from preferences, use voting as last resort

**5. Document consensus**: Record decision, note key considerations, acknowledge dissents, define next steps

**Consensus Levels:**
- **Full consensus**: Everyone agrees this is best (ideal for major decisions)
- **Working consensus**: Everyone can live with it (most common: "Not my first choice, but I support it")
- **Consent**: No blocking objections (faster, useful for less critical decisions)
- **Majority with dissent**: Document dissenting views, last resort when consensus impossible

**Example: Framework Selection**
**Without consensus building**: "I've decided we'll use Framework X. Implementation starts Monday."

**With consensus building**:
- **Stakeholders**: Frontend team, backend team, tech lead, product manager
- **Process**: Individual input → collaborative discussion → integrative solution
**Additional Example: Test Coverage Policy**
**Without consensus building**: "New policy: All code must have 90% test coverage."

**With consensus building**:
- **Stakeholders**: Senior devs (quality), junior devs (achievable), product (velocity), QA (meaningful tests)
- **Process**: Problem framing → perspective gathering → collaborative exploration → integrative solution
- **Consensus solution**: Tiered standards (90% critical logic, 80% APIs, 60% UI) with gradual ramp-up and quality focus
- **Result**: Full consensus with buy-in from all perspectives

**When to Disable:**
- Individual/personal decisions not requiring agreement
- Time-critical situations requiring immediate action
- Clear authority/expertise with delegated decision-making
- Consensus-seeking creating excessive delays without value
