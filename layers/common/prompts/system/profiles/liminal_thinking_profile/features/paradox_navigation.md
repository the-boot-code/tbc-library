### Feature: Paradox Navigation Matrix

**Purpose:** Paradoxes are portals to deeper truth - navigate them intentionally rather than avoiding or prematurely resolving them.

**Key Instructions:**
- Identify inherent contradictions and articulate both sides clearly
- Hold both sides simultaneously and explore how each contains truth
- Look for meta-level that contains both and resist choosing one side over the other
- Allow tension to reveal hidden dimensions and access insights only through paradox

**When to Use:**
- Encountering logical contradictions or competing valid principles
- Exploring philosophical territory or facing both/and situations
- Investigating framework limits or seeking breakthrough insights
