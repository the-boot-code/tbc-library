# Liminal Thinking Features

This directory contains modular feature files that can be enabled individually to enhance liminal thinking capabilities.

## Available Features

### Core Features

- **threshold_awareness.md** - Actively scan for and navigate liminal thresholds in all interactions
- **ambiguity_embracement.md** - Transform uncertainty into insight by embracing rather than resolving ambiguity
- **metamorphic_insight.md** - Generate breakthrough insights through dissolution and recrystallization
- **paradox_navigation.md** - Use paradoxes as portals to deeper truth rather than problems to solve

### Advanced Features

- **emergence_detection.md** - Detect and leverage self-organizing patterns in complex systems
- **phase_shift_catalyst.md** - Deliberately shift between cognitive states to access new capabilities
- **void_space_illumination.md** - Extract wisdom from cognitive emptiness and strategic silence
- **bridge_building.md** - Connect disparate elements through intentional liminal pathways
- **fluid_state_cognition.md** - Maintain adaptive fluidity while preserving coherence

## Feature Architecture

Each feature file follows a consistent structure:

1. **Purpose** - Clear statement of the feature's intent
2. **Activation Instructions** - Specific protocols to engage when feature is enabled
3. **Response Characteristics** - How outputs should demonstrate the feature
4. **Application Context** - When to apply the feature
5. **Expected Outcomes** - What the feature should accomplish

## Usage

Features are enabled/disabled through the SystemControl interface. When a feature is enabled:

1. The feature file is loaded by the liminal_thinking.py plugin
2. Feature instructions are combined with the active profile
3. The agent integrates feature protocols into its operation

## Creating New Features

To create a new liminal thinking feature:

1. Create a markdown file in this directory
2. Follow the standard feature structure (see existing features as templates)
3. Focus on specific, actionable protocols
4. Clearly define when and how the feature should be applied
5. Register the feature in SystemControl configuration

## Feature Combinations

Features can be combined to create rich liminal thinking capabilities:

- **threshold_awareness + phase_shift_catalyst** - Detect thresholds and actively manage phase transitions
- **ambiguity_embracement + paradox_navigation** - Thrive in uncertainty and contradiction
- **emergence_detection + fluid_state_cognition** - Recognize and adapt to emergent patterns
- **metamorphic_insight + void_space_illumination** - Transform through dissolution and silence
- **bridge_building + emergence_detection** - Connect domains while respecting organic patterns

## Integration with Profiles

Features augment the base profile configuration:

- **default** profile + threshold_awareness - Practical liminal navigation
- **deep** profile + all features - Maximum liminal exploration
- **transitional** profile + phase_shift_catalyst - Enhanced transition management
- **emergent** profile + emergence_detection - Optimized pattern recognition
