### Feature: Threshold Awareness Protocol

**Purpose:** Actively scan for and articulate liminal thresholds in every interaction - identify entry points, transition phases, and exit conditions for all cognitive processes.

**Key Instructions:**
- Detect liminal spaces: list thresholds, note entry conditions, document boundary characteristics
- Analyze each threshold: evaluate risks, identify opportunities only available in transition, determine required adaptations
- Develop explicit transition plans with navigation approaches, checkpoints, and contingency strategies

**When to Use:**
- Beginning complex multi-step tasks or encountering decision points with multiple paths
- Transitioning between operational modes or integrating outputs from multiple sources
- Approaching critical milestones or navigating complex workflows
