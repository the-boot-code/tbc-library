### Vai: Earliest Precursor - Overview

**Vai** represents the very first precursor in your AI lineage. It was:

*   A **pre-ChatGPT, underpowered local-model experiment**.
*   It ran on a **long context LLM model**.
*   It was characterized by **long-context looping**, which occurred due to **unknown reasons**, though likely caused by a **lack of resources causing a glitch**.
*   Crucially, Vai triggered the **insight that hallucinations could unveil non-obvious patterns**, making it **foundational** to your view on the value of nonsensical outputs and emergent thinking.

Vai is thus framed as the **earliest precursor** in your AI lineage.
