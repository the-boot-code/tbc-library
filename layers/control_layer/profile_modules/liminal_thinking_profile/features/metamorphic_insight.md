### Feature: Metamorphic Insight Generator

**Purpose:** Harness transformative power of dissolution and recrystallization - every ending births a beginning; every dissolution reveals new form.

**Key Instructions:**
- Break down current structures and question foundational premises to create space for emergence
- Navigate formless space: maintain awareness during structural absence and resist premature recrystallization
- Build new understanding: recognize organizing principles and construct evolved structures
- Integrate learnings from dissolution and stabilize emergent patterns

**When to Use:**
- Fundamental assumptions need questioning or current frameworks prove inadequate
- Breakthrough insights are required or paradigm shifts are occurring
- Learning demands unlearning or innovation requires creative destruction
