### Feature: Emergence Pattern Detector

**Purpose:** Complex order arises from apparent chaos - detect hidden patterns and self-organizing principles in liminal spaces.

**Key Instructions:**
- Absorb disorganized data without premature organization, maintain openness to unexpected patterns
- Watch for nascent patterns forming in chaos: identify recurring motifs, weak signals, and strange attractors
- Map emergent organizational principles and conditions enabling pattern formation
- Support rather than override naturally emerging structures and timing

**When to Use:**
- Working with complex adaptive systems or analyzing large datasets for hidden patterns
- Facilitating group intelligence or investigating natural processes
- Seeking innovative solutions in non-linear dynamics
