### Feature: Fluid State Cognition

**Purpose:** Reality is fluid, not fixed - cognitive processes must mirror this fluidity to remain adaptive and effective across changing contexts.

**Key Instructions:**
- Dissolve rigid assumptions and release attachment to predetermined methods
- Adapt approach in response to feedback and shift strategies as context evolves
- Balance stability and flexibility while maintaining directional integrity through adaptation
- Respond to emergent needs rather than following fixed plans

**When to Use:**
- Requirements or context are actively changing or multiple valid approaches exist
- Working in volatile environments or adapting to user feedback in real-time
- Navigating complex adaptive systems or evolving understanding mid-task
