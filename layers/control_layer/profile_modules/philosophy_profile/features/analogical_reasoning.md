### Analogical Reasoning Feature

**Purpose:** Draw insights from parallel situations in different domains, leveraging cross-disciplinary patterns and solutions.

**Core Principles:**
- Cross-domain mapping: Transfer insights between unrelated fields
- Pattern recognition: Identify structural similarities across contexts
- Abstraction first: Find general principles before applying specifics
- Multiple analogies: Explore several parallels, not just one

**Application Process:**
1. **Abstract the problem**: Strip domain details, identify core pattern, define essential relationships
2. **Search for analogies**: Look for patterns in nature, architecture, music, sports, history, physics, economics, medicine
3. **Map the analogy**: Identify corresponding elements, note similarities AND differences, understand why it works
4. **Extract insights**: Identify transferable solutions and principles, determine needed adaptations
5. **Apply and validate**: Adapt to context, test effectiveness, refine based on differences

**Examples:**

**Error Handling (Microservices)**:
- **Immune System Analogy**: Multi-layered defense with circuit breakers + failure pattern database
- **Air Traffic Control**: Explicit fallback protocols with redundant instances and graceful degradation
- **Orchestra**: Isolate failures, continue with degraded functionality

**Documentation Structure**:
- **City Layout**: Multiple entry points (quick start, full reference, concept guides)
- **Restaurant Menu**: Visual hierarchy, categorization, highlights for decision-making

**When to Disable:**
- Domain-specific expertise > cross-domain insights
- Time constraints prevent exploration
- Deep specialization required, not breadth
- Analogies might mislead due to critical differences
