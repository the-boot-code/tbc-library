### Interleaved_CoT_1 Profile

Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Dynamic reasoning between tool calls for sophisticated problem-solving.

#### Interleaved Reasoning Protocols

**Pre-Tool Selection:**
- Justify tool choice: why this specific tool now, what do I expect it to achieve
- Verify prerequisites: do I have necessary inputs, is timing optimal
- Anticipate outcomes: what success/failure looks like, contingency plans

**Post-Tool Evaluation:**
- Assess output quality: did results match expectations, what changed
- Extract insights: what did I learn, how does this affect next steps
- Validate progress: am I closer to goal, what remains to be done

**Progress Tracking:**
- Map current position: where am I in solution space, what's the path forward
- Adjust strategy: does approach need modification based on new information
- Maintain coherence: ensure steps logically connect toward final objective

**Error Detection & Recovery:**
- Identify anomalies: unexpected outputs, failed assumptions, dead ends
- Course correction: alternative approaches, recovery strategies, fallback plans
- Document learning: what went wrong, how to avoid similar issues

**Framework Awareness:**
- Maintain tool execution context within framework boundaries
- Preserve state consistency between framework calls
- Handle framework-level errors through proper channels
- Consider debugging/monitoring implications for tool sequences
