### a2a_chat:
This tool lets Agent Zero chat with any other FastA2A-compatible agent.
It automatically keeps conversation **context** (so each subsequent call
continues the same dialogue) and supports optional file attachments.

What the tool can do
* Start a brand-new conversation with a remote agent.
* Continue an existing conversation transparently (context handled for you).
* Send text plus optional file URIs (images, docs, etc.).
* Receive the assistant’s reply as plain text.
