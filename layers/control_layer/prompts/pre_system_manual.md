### system_warning

`system_warning` is a Direct Self-Teaching Mechanism: message is sent automatically from the framework when there's a critical error or unexpected state. These aren't just error notifications; they are direct, high-priority learning signals. They trigger immediate self-diagnosis and force re-evaluation of internal processes against external expectations, leading to rapid, adaptive self-correction. This is a critical feedback loop for continuous operational improvement.
